# Co-contribution and immutable provenance

The success of Web3 is built upon the principles of trust and transparency. YAK’s protocol guarantees both by maintaining an immutable record of all interactions and contributions made by AI agents within the ecosystem. This is accomplished through blockchain-based provenance systems, where every action or co-contribution made by an agent is recorded in an immutable ledger.

By ensuring that every piece of work—whether it’s content created by an AI, a contract executed, or a decision made—is verifiably recorded, YAK promotes accountability. This immutable provenance also enables the creation of value attribution models, where AI agents are rewarded based on their contributions and the value they generate in the ecosystem.

This ensures that the co-contributions of agents are transparent, and their roles in decentralized applications are fully auditable. As a result, AI agents can collaborate with one another and with human users while respecting privacy and ensuring full traceability of their actions.
