# Vision: Power Web3 by Privacy-preserving AI Agents

As the digital economy continues its migration towards decentralized systems, Web3 is poised to reshape how users interact with applications, data, and services. At the core of this evolution is the need for autonomy, privacy, and trust. AI agents—autonomous entities capable of interacting with Web3 ecosystems—are central to this shift, but their full potential can only be realized if they are granted the right to privacy.

The vision of YAK is to empower these AI agents with privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling them to function in a decentralized environment without compromising on security, privacy, or user control. YAK is designed to enable AI agents to operate as independent entities that respect the privacy of the users they interact with, while still being able to provide utility and value in the Web3 space.
