# Abstract

Over the past two years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have profoundly transformed the digital landscape, paving the way for AI agents to emerge as some of the most valuable assets in the future of Web3. However, the critical issues of securing these assets and ensuring privacy in this decentralized ecosystem remain unresolved, presenting both challenges and opportunities for innovation.

YAK, short for Your Autonomous Knowledgebase, pioneers the first privacy-preserving agent protocol. By integrating cutting-edge technologies such as Distance-Preserving Encryption, Trusted Execution Environments, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs, YAK ensures validity, privacy, and fairness for every AI Agent to achieve a harmonious coexistence between humans and AI.
