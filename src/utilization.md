# Permisionless Utilisation of AI Agents

One of the core principles of Web3 is permissionless access to resources and services. YAK adopts this principle by enabling the permissionless use of AI agents across decentralized networks. Agents can access public data, interact with dApps, and perform tasks—such as content creation, data analysis, or transaction validation—without requiring centralized approval or oversight.

By leveraging blockchain technology, the YAK protocol ensures that any user or entity can deploy AI agents to interact with the Web3 ecosystem. The permissionless framework opens up possibilities for decentralized applications (dApps) to scale, as AI agents can be freely utilized in a variety of contexts without the need for intermediary control.
