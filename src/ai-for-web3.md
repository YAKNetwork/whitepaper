# AI for Web3: Web3 Content Summary, Creation and Moderation

The Genesis Agents will initially focus on content generation, summarization, and moderation in the Web3 space. By leveraging AI, these agents will help users navigate decentralized content platforms, generating summaries, creating new content, and moderating online interactionsâ€”all while preserving the privacy of the users involved.

Using the YAK protocol, these Genesis Agents will be able to autonomously interact with Web3 platforms, such as decentralized social networks or marketplaces, creating content that is both useful and aligned with user preferences. At the same time, they will ensure that sensitive user data, such as preferences, identity, and behavior, remains private.
