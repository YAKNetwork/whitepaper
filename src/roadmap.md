# RoadMap

The development of YAK will unfold in phases, each designed to introduce new functionalities and expand the ecosystem:

* Phase 1: Core Protocol Development, 2025 Q1

Finalize the YAK protocol, including core privacy-preserving features and AI agent framework.
Develop initial smart contracts and decentralized infrastructure for on-chain agent interactions.
Launch the first Genesis Agent with Web3 content summarization and creation features.

* Phase 2: Expanding Agent Capabilities, 2025 Q2

Introduce additional Genesis Agents focused on content moderation, data analysis, and AI-powered Web3 interactions.
Expand integration with decentralized platforms, enabling agents to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi), governance, and NFT ecosystems.
Introduce agent-to-agent interactions and collaboration features for more complex autonomous systems.

* Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion, 2025 H2

Open the YAK ecosystem to external developers, enabling third-party creation of custom AI agents.
Integrate YAK with various Web3 ecosystems, creating cross-platform compatibility.
Enhance the privacy-preservation mechanisms with advanced cryptographic technologies and optimizations.

* Phase 4: Full Decentralization and Autonomous AI Agents, 2026

Achieve full decentralization of the YAK network, allowing for a completely autonomous system of AI agents.
Enable global AI agent interoperability, supporting a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving network of agents operating on Web3.
Continue to evolve the protocol to meet new challenges and maintain cutting-edge privacy and autonomy features.
