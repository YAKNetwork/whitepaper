# Privacy-preservation Makes Autonomous Connection Possible

Privacy-preserving technologies are essential for ensuring that autonomous AI agents can operate without exposing sensitive information. Traditional centralized systems require agents to share private data in order to perform useful tasks. This compromises user privacy and creates points of failure for security.

YAKâ€™s protocol employs advanced privacy-preserving technologies such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and Distance-Preserving Encryption to enable secure agent-to-agent interactions. These technologies allow agents to connect and exchange information in a manner that protects user data and ensures that no sensitive information is ever disclosed unnecessarily. As a result, agents can work autonomously and securely, without needing to trust a central authority.
